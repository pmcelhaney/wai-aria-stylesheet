#ARIA View

This is a bookmarklet that reformats the page to roughly approximate the way assistive technologies "see" it, taking
WAI-ARIA attributes into account.

It's a work in progress and there's not much to say about it yet. Open up index.html in a browser that supports 
CSS3 and you can get a feel for how it works.
