<h1>ARIA View Bookmarklet</h1>


<p>Do you ever wonder what it's like to browse your web app as a <strong>blind person</strong>?</p>

<p>Have you been charged with making your web app more <strong>accessible</strong>?</p>

<p>If so, you should probably take the time to learn how to use a screen reader such as JAWS or VoiceOver. There's no 
substitute for diving in and experiencing for yourself the challenges a visually impaired user faces when using your app.
However, testing code with a screen reader can feel unfamiliar and time-consuming for a developer with normal eyesight. Wouldn't
it be great if <strong>we could just see what a screen reader "sees"</strong>?

<p>ARIA View is an attempt at such a tool. It reformats an HTML page to approximate how a page is perceived by assistive technology. It's super easy to use. Just <strong>drag this button up to the bookmarks bar in your browser</strong>. Then click the "bookmark" while you're inside your web application or site.</p>

<p>
<a class="bookmarklet" href="javascript:(function(){ var root = 'https://raw.github.com/pmcelhaney/wai-aria-stylesheet/'; var script=document.createElement('script');script.src=root+'bookmarklet.js';script.onload=function(){window.waiAriaView(root);};document.body.appendChild(script);}());">Aria View</a></p>




<p>ARIA View is already super useful, but it's still under development. If you're looking a polished tool that will help you make your web site more accessible, check out <a href="http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/">HTML Codesniffer</a>.</p>	


<p>If you're a developer, this is a great opportunity to <a href="https://github.com/pmcelhaney/wai-aria-stylesheet">get involved in an open source project</a> during the embryonic stage.</p>
